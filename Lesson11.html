<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Sophia and Emmy need to make a decision where they must compare two
options. We often face situations with different options where we can
use the Quantitative Reasoning Process to compare our options. There are
several different quantitative tools we can use to make this type of
comparison. One tool we look at in this lesson is a <em>system of
equations</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>system of equations</em> is a list of two or more equations
that use the same input and output variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can use graphs or algebra to solve for the values of the variables
that satisfy both equations. Let’s start by looking at how Sophia and
Emmy use a system of equations to decide between renting the monster
truck or renting the boat.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step one">
Understand the Problem
</h4>
<p>Sophia and Emmy need to find a way back to their hotel from the
jungle. They are faced with a decision where they need to compare the
cost of two different things, renting the monster truck or renting the
motor boat.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step two">
Identify Variables &amp; Assumptions
</h4>
<p>We identify the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of kilometers Sophia and Emmy need to travel</li>
<li>The total cost of transportation out of the jungle</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sophia and Emmy can drive either the truck or the boat.</li>
<li>Sophia can use her emergency credit card that was not swallowed by
the black caiman.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can set up two equations that are related to each other because
the variables are the same in both cases: the total cost of
transportation out of the jungle and the number of kilometers. With
either the monster truck or the motor boat we are focused on money and
distance.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step three">
Apply Quantitative Tools
</h4>
<p>We can model each scenario with a mathematical equation.</p>
<p>The total cost, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, of the truck
is $37.50 + $0.88 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>
kilometers: <span class="math inline">\(y=37.50+0.88x\)</span><br />
The total cost, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, of the boat is
$60.00 +$0.19 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> kilometers:
<span class="math inline">\(y=60+0.19x\)</span></p>
<p>The input value, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, in each of
the equations is the number of kilometers they travel. The output value
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, is the total cost of
transportation.</p>
<p>As we learned in Chapter 7 the two equations in this example are
linear equations. The rate of change (or slope) in each equation is
constant. When we plot this type equation we get a straight line.</p>
<p>Let’s look more carefully at the graph of the two lines representing
the situation. The blue line represents the cost of the monster truck as
the kilometers increase. The red line represents the cost of the boat as
the kilometers increase.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see from the graph that the two lines cross at around 33
kilometers on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis and just
above $65 on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis.</p>
<p>If Sophia and Emmy travel less than 33 kilometers then the truck is
the least expensive. If they travel more than 33 kilometers then the
boat is the least expensive.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step four">
Make an Informed Decision
</h4>
<p>Sophia and Emmy need more information to make an informed decision.
They really need to know the distance from their jungle position back to
town.</p>
<p>After asking for more information, they find that the dirt road back
to the hotel is about 40 kilometers long and the river trip is 38
kilometers. Use the equations we built to compute the cost of each
rental vehicle.</p>

<hr>
<h4 class="step five">
Evaluate Your Reasoning
</h4>
<p>Sophia and Emmy tie the boat up at the town marina and ask directions
to their hotel. After finding out that they have 5 kilometers still to
walk they rethink their decision.</p>
<p>Sophia and Emmy have realized that they made an incorrect assumption
in their application of the Quantitative Reasoning process. They
mistakenly assumed that both modes of transportation would get them back
to their hotel. But since they didn’t realize that travel by boat would
also require a 5 kilometer walk, they made a decision that didn’t turn
out to be the best.</p>
<p>Because the difference in price between the rentals was relatively
small, they now wish they had rented the monster truck and driven
straight to the hotel.</p>
<hr>
<p>The remainder of this lesson will focus on the powerful quantitative
tool, systems of equations, that we used to understand Sophia and Emmy’s
situation.</p>
<p>There are several different techniques that can be used to solve
systems of equations. We will look at two of them: solving systems of
equations with graphs and solving systems of equations with algebra.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="solving-systems-with-graphs" class="section level2">
<h2>Solving Systems with Graphs</h2>
<p>The graph of an equation represents all the points that satisfy the
equation. When we are solving a system of equations we want to find a
point that satisfies all of the equations in the system. This means that
if you graph both equations in a system of two equations on a graph you
can find the solution to the system by finding all points where the
graphs intersect. An intersection point satisfies both equations so it
represents the solution we are looking for.</p>
<div id="example-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Graph the following two equations to solve the system of
equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
3x+2y&amp;=5\\
x-y&amp;=0\\
\end{align}
\]</span> <strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>We want to find a point <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span>
that satisfies both equations. This means the point we are looking for
will be the point where the two graphs intersect. If we solve each
equation for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we will see that
they fit the pattern of a linear function and we will be able to graph
the lines.</p>
<p>Equation 1: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
3x+2y&amp;=5\\
2y&amp;=-3x+5\\
y&amp;=\frac{-3}{2}x+\frac{5}{2}
\end{align}
\]</span> Equation 2:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
x-y&amp;=0\\
-y&amp;=-x\\
y&amp;=x\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Equation 1 can be represented with a line with a <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{2}\)</span> and a slope of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{-3}{2}\)</span>. Equation 2 gives the graph
of a line with a <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept of 0
and a slope of 1. If we plot both lines on the same graph, they look
like this:</p>
<p><img src="Lesson11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The solution to the system of equations is represented on the graph
by the point where the two lines intersect. By looking at the graph of
these two lines, we can see that they cross at the point <span
class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span>. This means <span
class="math inline">\(x=1, y=1\)</span> is the solution to the system of
equations.</p>
<p><strong>Check Our Answer</strong></p>
<p>We can verify that <span class="math inline">\(x=1, y=1\)</span> is
the solution to the system by checking that <span
class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span> is exactly the point where they
cross. We do this by substituting in these values for <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in both equations and making sure that
both mathematical statements are true.</p>
<p>Equation 1:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
3x+2y&amp;=5\\
3(1)+2(1)&amp;=5\\
3+2&amp;=5\\
5&amp;=5\\
\text{True}&amp;\text{ Statement}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Equation 2:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
x-y&amp;=0\\
1-1&amp;=0\\
0&amp;=0\\
\text{True}&amp;\text{ Statement}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The point <span class="math inline">\((1,1)\)</span> is the only
point where the two lines cross, <em>and</em> the values <span
class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y=1\)</span> are the only values for <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that will yield true statements for
both equations. When we get a single unique solution like this, we say
that the system of equations is <em>independent</em>.</p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="example-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>Graph the following two equations to solve the system of
equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
-x+2y&amp;=4\\
-3x+6y&amp;=-18\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>If we solve each equation for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>,
we can see that each one fits the pattern of a linear function and can
graph the lines.</p>
<p>Equation 1:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
-x+2y&amp;=4\\
2y&amp;=x+4\\
y&amp;=\frac{x+4}{2}\\
y&amp;=\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{4}{2}\\
y&amp;=\frac{1}{2}x+2\\
\end{align}
\]</span> The first equation can be graphed as a line with a slope of
1/2 and a <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept of 2.</p>
<p>Equation 2:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
-3x+6y&amp;=-18\\
6y&amp;=3x-18\\
y&amp;=\frac{3x-18}{6}\\
y&amp;=\frac{3}{6}x-\frac{18}{6}\\
y&amp;=\frac{1}{2}x-3\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The second equation can be graphed as a line with a slope of 1/2 and
a <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept of -3.</p>
<p>If we plot both lines on the same graph, they look like this:</p>
<p><img src="Lesson11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From the graph it looks like the lines are parallel, which means they
will never cross. We can see from the equations that the lines are
parallel because the two lines have the same slope. This means that
there is no <span class="math inline">\(x,y\)</span> pair that will
satisfy both equations and thus there is no solution to this system of
linear equations. When there is no solution to a system of equations we
say that the system of equations is <em>inconsistent</em>.</p>

<h2>Solving Systems with Algebra</h2>
<p>Graphing systems of equations helps us to visualize the system and
the solutions but unless the equations and solutions are fairly simple
it can be difficult to obtain accurate results. We can also solve
systems of equations using techniques of algebra. The <em>Substitution
Method</em> is one way to solve a system of equations. To solve a system
of equations using the substitution method we eliminate one variable
from one of the equations by substituting an expression for that
variable from the other equation.</p>
<div id="example-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Example 3</h3>
<p>Use the substitution method to solve the system of equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
2x-y&amp;=-5\\
3x+5y&amp;=12\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>To solve this system using the substitution method, we first solve
the first equation for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
2x-y&amp;=-5\\
-y&amp;=-2x-5\\
y&amp;=2x+5\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now, we substitute the expression <span
class="math inline">\(2x+5\)</span> in for the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in the other equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
3x+5y&amp;=12\\
3x+5(2x+5)&amp;=12\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Because we have an equation with only <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s in it, we can solve for <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
3x+5(2x+5)&amp;=12\\
3x+10x+25&amp;=12\\
13x+25&amp;=12\\
13x&amp;=12-25\\
13x&amp;=-13\\
x&amp;=\frac{-13}{13}\\
x&amp;=-1\\
\end{align}
\]</span> We know <span class="math inline">\(x=-1\)</span> so we can
substitute this value for the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in
the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-expression we found earlier,
<span class="math inline">\(y=2x+5\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
y&amp;=2x+5\\
y&amp;=2(-1)+5\\
y&amp;=-2+5\\
y&amp;=3
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We have found the solution to this system of equations to be <span
class="math inline">\(x=-1, y=3\)</span>. Because there is a single
solution to this system of equations, it is independent. The graph of
these two equations verifies this solution because the lines intersect
at the point <span class="math inline">\((-1,3)\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="example-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Example 4</h3>
<p>Use the substitution method to solve the system of equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
6x-9y&amp;=-13\\
18x-3y&amp;=1\\
\end{align}
\]</span> <strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>We need to solve for one of the variables in one of the equations. We
will solve for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in the second
equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
18x-3y&amp;=1\\
-3y&amp;=-18x+1\\
y&amp;=\frac{-18x+1}{-3}\\
y&amp;=\frac{-18}{-3}x+\frac{1}{-3}\\
y&amp;=6x-\frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
\]</span> Now that we know <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in
terms of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we can substitute this
into the first equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
6x-9y&amp;=-13\\
6x-9(6x-\frac{1}{3})&amp;=-13\\
6x-54x+\frac{9}{3}&amp;=-13\\
-48x+3&amp;=-13\\
-48x&amp;=-13-3\\
-48x&amp;=-16\\
x&amp;=\frac{-16}{-48}\\
x&amp;=\frac{1}{3}\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can now substitute <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> in for <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in any of the equations to find <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
y&amp;=6x-\frac{1}{3}\\
y&amp;=6(\frac{1}{3})-\frac{1}{3}\\
y&amp;=\frac{6}{3}-\frac{1}{3}\\
y&amp;=\frac{6-1}{3}\\
y&amp;=\frac{5}{3}\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This system of equations is independent. The only solution that works
for both equations is <span class="math inline">\(x=\frac{1}{3},
y=\frac{5}{3}\)</span>. The two lines cross at the point <span
class="math inline">\(\big(\frac{1}{3},\frac{5}{3}\big)\)</span>.</p>

<h2>Solving in Context</h2>
<div id="piano-sales-example" class="section level3">
<h3>Piano Sales Example</h3>
<hr>
<h4 class="step one">
Understand the Problem
</h4>
<p>Jasper loves music and has recently been hired as a piano salesman.
His new boss asked him to choose a commission plan. He can choose Plan A
or Plan B. For Plan A Jasper gets a base salary of $25,000 a year plus a
$500 commission for each piano he sells. In Plan B Jasper gets a base
salary of $30,000 a year plus a $200 commission for each piano.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step two">
Identify Variables &amp; Assumptions
</h4>
<p>Jasper identifies two variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of pianos sold per year</li>
<li>The total amount of money he earns in the year.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 class="step three">
Apply Quantitative Tools
</h4>
<p>Because Plan A and Plan B have the same two variables, Jasper can
model his situation using a system of equations to better understand the
decision he needs to make.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan A: the money he earns in one year = $25,000 + $500 for each
piano</li>
<li>Plan B: the money he earns in one year = $30,000 + $200 for each
piano</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be turned into the following system of equations where the
input variable, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, represents the
number of pianos Jasper sells in a year and the output variable, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, represents the total amount of money
he earns in one year.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
y&amp;=500x+25000\\
y&amp;=200x+30000\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Because both equations are already solved for <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> we can substitute <span
class="math inline">\(200x+30000\)</span> in for <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in the first equation and solve for
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
200x+30000&amp;=500x+25000\\
200x-500x&amp;=25000-30000\\
-300x&amp;=-5000\\
x&amp;=\frac{-5000}{-300}\\
x&amp;=16.67\\
\end{align}
\]</span> We can now substitute <span
class="math inline">\(x=16.67\)</span> into any of the equations to find
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
y&amp;=500x+25000\\
y&amp;=500(16.67)+25000\\
y&amp;=33335\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The solution to the system is <span class="math inline">\(x=16.67,
y=\$33,335\)</span>.</p>
<p>The following graph of this system supports this solution:</p>
<p><img src="Lesson11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step four">
Make an Informed Decision
</h4>
<p>From this solution, Jasper knows if he sells around 16 or 17 pianos
the two plans pay about the same and he would make around $33,335 per
year. If he sells more than 16 pianos, Plan A is a better plan because
he earns more money in a year. If he sells 16 pianos or fewer, Plan B is
a better plan.</p>
<p>He believes he can sell at least 2 pianos per month. Since this a
total of 24 pianos he decides to select Plan A.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step five">
Evaluate Your Reasoning
</h4>
<p>Before telling his boss his decision, Jasper decides to ask some of
the other salesman how many pianos they sold the previous year. He talks
to three of them and finds that they sold 18, 31, and 22 pianos each.
Because these values are all more than 17, Jasper is satisfied with his
decision to chose Plan A and tells his boss of his decision.</p>

<h2>Systems and Trendlines</h2>
<p>Often, the equations that make up a system of equations are obtained
from data using a trendline. The following example looks at an example
from business: the break-even point.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step one">
Understand the Problem
</h4>
<p>Jeff and Lucas opened a pizzeria. They have been open for 10 months
now and are doing some calculations to determine what they could do to
improve their profits. Currently, they charge $10 for the large pizza,
their best-selling item. During the 10 months their restaurant has been
open, they collected the following data:</p>
<center>
<img src="Lesson11/Images/pizzadata.PNG"
alt="Spreadsheet containing pizza sales data" />
</center>
<p>They want to answer two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many pizzas do we need to sell to break even each month?</li>
<li>Should we change the price of our large pizza?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 class="step two">
Identify Variables &amp; Assumptions
</h4>
<p>Jeff and Lucas identify the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of pizzas sold each month</li>
<li>Total cost each month (how much money they have to pay to keep the
business open)</li>
<li>Total revenue each month (the total amount of money they bring in
during one month)</li>
<li>Total profit each month (total revenue minus total cost)</li>
</ul>
<p>They make the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>They will break-even if their monthly revenue is equal to their
monthly costs</li>
<li>If they change the price of the pizza, the number of pizzas sold
will stay the same</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 class="step three">
Apply Quantitative Tools
</h4>
<p>Jeff and Lucas create the following scatter plot and trendlines to
compare their revenue and costs. The input variable, <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, represents the number of pizzas sold
in one month. The output variable, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, represents money. We can see the data
and the trendline for both the total revenue (orange) and total cost
(blue).</p>
<center>
<img src="Lesson11/Images/revenuecosts.png"
alt="Scatter plot representing Revenue and Costs" />
</center>
<p>These two trendlines give them a system of equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
y&amp;=10.893x + 217.7\\
y&amp;=5.8929x + 5803.9\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Jeff and Lucas use substitution to solve the system of equations.
Because both equations are already solved for <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, they can set the equations equal to
each other and solve for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
10.893x + 217.7 &amp;= 5.8929 x + 5803.90\\
10.893x - 5.8929 x &amp;= 5803.90 - 217.7\\
5.0001x &amp;= 5586.20\\
x&amp;=\frac{5586.20}{5.0001}\\
x&amp;=1117.2177\\
\end{align}
\]</span> They can then substitute this value of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> back into any of the equations to solve
for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. They used the first
equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
y&amp;=10.893x + 217.7\\
y&amp;=10.893(1117.2177)+217.7\\
y&amp;=12387.5524\\
\end{align}
\]</span> The solution to the system of equations is <span
class="math inline">\(x=1117.2177, y=12387.5524\)</span>.</p>
<p>Jeff and Lucas know that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
represents the number of pizzas sold and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> represents a dollar amount. This
solution means that if Jeff and Lucas sell 1,117 pizzas they will
break-even and their revenue and costs will both be about
$12,387.55.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step four">
Make an Informed Decision
</h4>
<p>These calculations give Jeff and Lucas the answer to their first
question: How many pizzas do they need to sell to break even each month?
They need to sell around 1,117 pizzas per month. Because they are closed
on Sunday, their pizzeria is open for around 26 days per month. They
divide the number of pizzas by the number of days and get 42.96. This
means they need to sell an average of 43 pizzas every day in order to
break even.</p>
<p>Looking back at the data, Jeff and Lucas notice that they sold more
than 1,117 pizzas in 5 of the past 10 months: May, June, September,
October, and November. They are concerned that they sold fewer than
1,117 pizzas in the other 5 months. But they notice that the most recent
three months have had good sales. They hope that this upward trend in
pizza sales continues as their pizzeria becomes more popular.</p>
<p>To answer the question of whether they should increase the price of
the large pizza, they notice that in the past three months, although
they have sold more than 1,117 pizzas their total revenue was not much
larger than their total costs. That means their profits were relatively
low. They decide to increase the price of the large pizza to $11. They
hope the extra revenue will increase their profits.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step five">
Evaluate Your Reasoning
</h4>
<p>As Jeff and Lucas evaluate their reasoning, they re-examine their
assumptions. One of their assumptions was: “If they change the price of
the pizza, the number of pizzas sold will stay the same.” As they think
about this assumption, they realize it is probably not very accurate.
Reducing prices would probably increase sales, while increasing prices
would probably decrease sales. Because their decision was to increase
the price of the large pizza to $11, Jeff and Lucas realize they might
see a decrease in sales. They decide to try the higher price for three
months and then re-evaluate their decision.</p>
<p>After three more months of sales, Jeff and Lucas reevaluate their
decision. In those three months they sold 1410, 1511, and 1620 pizzas.
So far, it appears that the increase in their prices has not decreased
their sales too much. Their sales remain above the 1,117 pizzas they
calculated that they needed to sell in order to break even. Because they
raised the price of the large pizza they find that their revenue has
increased, so their profits are also increasing. Jeff and Lucas decide
to do more advertising. They know that if they can sell more pizzas
their profits will continue to increase.</p>

</div>
<div id="non-linear-systems" class="section level2">
<h2>Non-linear Systems</h2>
<p>So far, all of the systems of equations we have encountered in this
lesson have involved linear equations. Linear systems are the most
common type of system that appear in real life problems. Because a line
is simple, both in a graph and in an equation, we often choose to model
situations with lines. This can be especially useful when the solution
does not have to be precise, like rounding up to the nearest pizza or
the nearest dollar.</p>
<p>However, sometimes situations need more precision or sometimes a line
is not a close enough model and it is helpful to use non-linear models.
There are ways to solve non-linear systems with algebra, but in this
class, we will only solve non-linear systems using graphs.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a non-linear system of equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
y&amp;=8x^2+12x+1\\
y&amp;=2(4)^x+3\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the first equation is a quadratic function and the second
equation is an exponential function. When we graph these functions we
get the following:</p>
<p><img src="Lesson11_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Notice there are three solutions to this system of equations because
the graphs intersect at three different points. It is difficult to
determine the exact location of the intersection points from the graph,
but we can tell they are somewhere around the points <span
class="math inline">\((-1.6,3.5)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\((0.3,6)\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\((2.8, 95)\)</span>.</p>
