<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lesson we are focusing on the third step of the Quantitative
Reasoning Process: <em>Apply Quantitative Tools</em>. Last week we
learned about functions. This week we will expand our knowledge of
functions to see how they help solve some important questions from
everyday life when used as a tool in the Quantitative Reasoning
Process.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson2/Images/QRProcess.png"
alt="image of Quantitative Reasoning Process Model" /></p>
<p>In the opening story of this lesson, Sophia and Emmy used carbon-14
dating to solve the mystery about which statue was real and which was
fake. Carbon-14 dating is a method that uses <em>exponential
functions</em> to determine the age of an object that contains organic
material.</p>
<p>Although Sophia and Emmy’s story is a fictional bedtime story,
similar uses of mathematical functions and the Quantitative Reasoning
Process help solve many different types of problems encountered in every
day life such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long will it take me to pay off this loan?</li>
<li>How much money should I save each month if I want to buy a car?</li>
<li>How much money should I save each month in order to retire at age
62?</li>
<li>How many calories should I eat each day if I want to compete in a
triathlon?</li>
<li>Should I buy a car with better gas mileage?</li>
<li>Should I accept a job offer that pays commission rather than a
salary?</li>
<li>Which health insurance plan is best for my situation?</li>
<li>How much money do I need to start a community charity?</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, real life methods similar to those depicted in Sophia and
Emmy’s story are currently used to fight the poaching of elephants in
Asia and Africa. The Poachers kill elephants for the ivory in their
tusks. These poaching deaths have led to declining elephant populations
over the past century. In an effort to protect elephants, international
agreements banned the trade of raw ivory from Asia and Africa in the
1970s and 1980s. However, 30,000 elephants are still killed every year
by poachers who illegally take their tusks. Detecting poached ivory had
previously been too expensive and time consuming for governments to
enforce these trade laws.</p>
<p>Recently researchers at the University of Utah developed methods to
use carbon-14 dating to determine the age of ivory. The new method is
less expensive than previous methods so it is more accessible to
government agencies. The carbon-14 dating method is used to determine if
the sample of ivory is old and comes from an elephant killed before the
ivory trade ban, or if the ivory is recent and comes from a poached
elephant. Governments can now identify illegally sourced ivory and fight
poaching of elephants, all because of the wise use of mathematical
functions and the Quantitative Reasoning Process. <a href="#fn1"

</div>
<div id="the-coordinate-plane" class="section level2">
<h2>The Coordinate Plane</h2>
<p>When we use functions it is helpful to create a graph of the
function. Functions are graphed on the coordinate plane. The horizontal
axis (also called the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis)
represents the inputs of a function and the vertical axis (also called
the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis) represents the outputs
of the function.</p>
<p>Every point on the graph represents an input and output of the
function. We represent each point as an <em>ordered pair</em>, <span
class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span>, where the first number is the
input and the second number is the output. The point <span
class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span> is referred to as the
<em>origin</em>.</p>
<p>When we graph a function, the graph is a visual representation of all
the inputs and corresponding outputs of the function. For example, the
following graph represents the function <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Every point on the curve represents an input and an output of the
function. Notice that the point <span
class="math inline">\((2,4)\)</span> is a point on the curve. That is
because if you use 2 as an input in the function <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span> then you get an output of 4. In
other words, <span class="math inline">\(f(2)=4\)</span>. Some of the
other ordered pairs related to this function are: <span
class="math inline">\((-1,1), (3,9), (-2,4),\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((0,0)\)</span>. Notice that if you use the first
number in each pair as an input of the function <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span> then you get the second number
as the output.</p>
</div>
<div id="three-types-of-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Three Types of Functions</h2>
<p>Functions can be divided into <em>families</em> of functions. Each
family represents a group of functions with similar properties. We will
focus on three common families of functions: linear functions, quadratic
functions, and exponential functions. There are many more families of
functions, but these three function families are very helpful for
solving everyday problems and making informed decisions.</p>
<div id="linear-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Linear Functions</h3>
<p>Linear functions help us describe or mathematically model real world
situations where something is changing at a constant rate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>linear function</strong> is a function of the form <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=mx+b\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are constants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two features that help us graph a linear function are the
<em>slope</em> and the <em>y-intercept</em>. The equation <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=mx+b\)</span> is said to be in
slope-intercept form.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept is the point
on the graph where the line crosses the vertical axis (<span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis).</p></li>
<li><p>The slope of a line is a number that tells us how steep the line
is. If the slope is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span>,
starting from any point on the line, we go up 2 units for every 3 units
we go to the right. If the slope is <span
class="math inline">\(-4\)</span>, we would start at any point on the
line and then go down 4 units for each 1 unit we go to the
right.</p></li>
</ul>
<center>
<img src="Lesson8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="652.8" />
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>The graph of a linear function, <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=mx+b\)</span> is a straight line that crosses
the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis at the point <span
class="math inline">\((0,b)\)</span> and has a slope of <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving the sliders in the example below will show how changing the
slope and the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept changes
the graph of the line.</p>

<p>Determine which of the following are linear functions:<br />
a. <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=3x-2\)</span><br />
b. <span class="math inline">\(3x+4y=-7\)</span><br />
c. <span class="math inline">\(y=4x^2-\sqrt{3}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<div id="part-a." class="section level5">
<h5>Part a.</h5>
<p>The function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=3x-2\)</span> is a
linear function because its form matches the general form of a linear
function: <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=mx+b\)</span>. In this
example, <span class="math inline">\(m=3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b=-2\)</span>. We could graph this function by
using the fact that it will cross the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis at the point <span
class="math inline">\((0,-2)\)</span> and has a slope of <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<img src="Lesson8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />
<hr>
</div>
<div id="part-b." class="section level5">
<h5>Part b.</h5>
<p>The function <span class="math inline">\(3x+4y=-7\)</span> is also a
linear function. It is not currently in the form <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=mx+b\)</span>, but we could rewrite it in
this form using some algebra rules. First, we solve the equation for
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
3x+4y&amp;=-7\\
4y&amp;=-3x-7\\
y&amp;=\frac{-3x-7}{4}\\
y&amp;=\frac{-3}{4}x-\frac{7}{4}.\\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Recall from last week’s lesson that <span
class="math inline">\(y=f(x)\)</span>, so we can change the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to an <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. This makes the equation: <span
class="math display">\[f(x)=\frac{-3}{4}x-\frac{7}{4}.\]</span></p>
<p>Now this function is written in the slope-intercept form of a linear
function. We could graph it using a <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{-7}{4}\)</span> and a slope of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{-3}{4}\)</span>.</p>
<img src="Lesson8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />
<hr>
</div>
<div id="part-c." class="section level5">
<h5>Part c.</h5>
The equation <span class="math inline">\(y=4x^2-\sqrt{3}\)</span> is not
a linear function. Notice that in a linear function the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> variable is not squared. Because
equation c. has an <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> term, we
know it is not a linear function. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

<h5>Example 8A</h5>
<p>Graph the linear function <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=\frac{4}{5}x-3\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> The equation of this linear function is
written in slope-intercept form, so we know the y-intercept is <span
class="math inline">\((0,-3)\)</span> and the slope is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{5}\)</span>. We can use this information
to help us graph the function:</p>

<h4>A Linear Application - Calories per Day</h4>
<p>A calorie is a unit of measurement that we use to measure energy.
Sarah is a 22-year-old woman with an average weight and height but who
does very little physical activity. Nevertheless, in a given day, she
spends about 1860 calories of energy.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This means if Sarah eats more than 1860
calories in a day, her body will store the extra calories and she will
gain weight. If she eats less than 1860 calories in a day, her body will
need to use some of the stored calories to make up the difference and
she will lose weight.</p>
<p>Sarah is trying to improve her health and realizes that by
exercising, she can increase her caloric expenditure. Sarah decides to
start walking each morning before she goes to work. She has determined
that for her weight and the speed (15 minutes per mile), she will burn
about 6 calories for each minute she walks<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Her schedule varies every day so she can’t always walk for the same
amount of time. However, Sarah realizes that she can create a linear
function that will give her the total amount of calories she can consume
that is based on the number of minutes she walks. This will allow her to
better monitor her caloric expenditure and meet her health goals.</p>
<p>The number of calories she spends on a day she doesn’t go for a walk,
1860 calories, will be the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept of the linear function. The
slope of the function will be the number of calories burned per minute,
or 6 calories per minute. This gives her the following linear
function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x)=6 x+1860
\]</span> Sarah makes the following chart to determine how many total
calories she would need each day, depending on how long her walk is:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> = Length of Walk</th>
<th><span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> = Total calories</th>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>On a day when Sarah walked 30 minutes prior to work, she used the
following graph to help her see how the walk effected the total number
of calories she would burn that day. Based on this graph, she knows that
her caloric expenditure is 2040 calories.</p>

<h3>Quadratic Functions</h3>
<p>Another commonly used type of graph represents a quadratic
function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>quadratic function</strong> is a function in the form <span

class="math inline">\(a, b\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are constants.</p>

<p>The graph of a quadratic function is always a <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>-shaped curve called a parabola. Three
features that help us graph a quadratic function are the <em><span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept</em>, the <em>direction</em>
the parabola opens, and the <em>vertex</em> of the parabola.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>y-intercept</em> is the point on the graph where the
parabola crosses the vertical axis (<span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis).</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>direction</em> of the parabola refers to whether the
u-shape of the parabola opens up or opens down.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>vertex</em> of the parabola is either the highest or the
lowest point on the parabola (depending on the direction of the
parabola).</p></li>

<p>Both equations a. and c. are quadratic functions.</p>
<p>Notice that equation a. is already written in the form <span

Equation b. is not a quadratic function because the <span

<div id="example-10" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 10</h4>
<p>Sketch the graph of <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)=2x^2-4x+1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>First, we find the vertex of the parabola. We know it is at the point
where <span class="math inline">\(x=\frac{-b}{2a}\)</span>. So in this
function the vertex will be at <span
class="math display">\[x=\frac{-b}{2a}=\frac{-(-4)}{2\times2}=\frac{4}{4}=1.\]</span>
Since we know the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> value of the
vertex will be at <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>, we can find
<span class="math inline">\(f(1)\)</span> to find the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-value of the vertex. <span
class="math display">\[f(1)=2(1^2)-4(1)+1=2-4+1=-1.\]</span> So we know
the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-value of the vertex is <span
class="math inline">\(y=-1\)</span>. Therefore, the vertex of this
parabola is <span class="math inline">\((1,-1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, we find where the parabola crosses the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis. We know this happens at the point
<span class="math inline">\((0,c)\)</span>, so in this example the
parabola will cross the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis at
the point <span class="math inline">\((0,1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, we determine whether the parabola opens up or down. In this
parabola, <span class="math inline">\(a=2\)</span>. Because <span
class="math inline">\(a&gt;0\)</span> we know the parabola opens up.</p>
<p>Putting all this information together gives us the following

<h4>A Quadratic Application - Exploding Fireworks</h4>
<p>One famous application of quadratic functions was discovered by the
Italian mathematician and physicist Galileo Galilei.</p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the 16th century, Galileo developed the following equation to show
the path of a free-falling object:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x)=-16x^2+v_0 x+h
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> represents time,
<span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span> represents the initial velocity
of the object, and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> represents the
initial height of the object (in feet). The input of the function
represents how long the object has been in the air and the output of the
function is the height of the object above the ground.</p>
<p>Andre is designing a fireworks show. He knows that he will fire a
rocket from a location 2 feet above the ground and it will have an
initial velocity of 203 ft/sec. </p>
<p>Andre needs to know how long to make the fuse of the rocket. For
safety reasons, he needs to make sure the firework will be more than 500
feet above the ground when it explodes. He wants to have the firework
explode when reaches its highest point.</p>
<p>Using Galileo’s free-fall equation, Andre finds this equation for his
rocket:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x)=-16x^2+203x+2\]</span></p>
<p>Because of the negative in the equation, he knows the parabola opens
down, so the highest point will be at the vertex of the parabola. He
finds the vertex of the parabola: <span
class="math display">\[x=\frac{-b}{2a}=\frac{-203}{2\cdot
-16}=6.34\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[f(6.34)=-16(6.34)^2+203(6.34)+2=645.89\]</span>
Since the vertex of the parabola is <span class="math inline">\((6.34,
645.89)\)</span>, Andre knows the rocket will be 645.89 feet above the
ground 6.34 seconds after he fires the rocket. So, he needs to use a
fuse that will burn for 6.34 seconds.</p>
<p>Andre’s graph verifies his solution:</p>

<p>There are three features that help graph exponential functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>y-intercept</em> is the point where the graph crosses the
vertical axis (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis).</li>
<li>The <em>horizontal asymptote</em> is a line that the function gets
closer and closer to, but never crosses.</li>
<li>The graph can be either <em>increasing</em> or <em>decreasing</em>.
An increasing graph goes up as you move along the graph from left to

<div id="an-exponential-application---carbon-14-dating"
class="section level4">
<h4>An Exponential Application - Carbon-14 Dating</h4>
<p>In the introduction we learned that carbon-14 dating is used to
determine the age of organic materials. This is a good example of an
application involving exponential functions.</p>
<p>Carbon-14 dating works by comparing the ratio of carbon-14 to
carbon-12 in the organic material. Carbon-12 is a stable form of carbon
that does not decay over time. Carbon-14, on the other hand, is
radioactive, and is therefore an unstable form of carbon. Living things
have a consistent ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14. However, when an
organism dies, it stops replenishing carbon-14 into its chemical makeup.
Without new carbon-14 sources being introduced into the organism, the
carbon-14 will decay over time into elements other than carbon. The will
cause the carbon-12 to carbon-14 ratio to change with time. By looking
at the current carbon-12 to carbon-14 ratio of the dead organism and
comparing ti to a carbon-12 to carbon-14 ratio in a living organism,
scientists can use this difference to calculate how long an organism has
been dead.</p>
<p>This is what is used to determine the age of ivory. While the tusk is
still intact on a living elephant, the ratio of carbon-12 and carbon-14
will stay consistent. But when the tusk is removed from the elephant,
the amount of carbon-14 begins to change.</p>
<p>The half-life of carbon-14 is about 5,730 years. This means that half
of the carbon-14 decays away every 5,730 years. Knowing this, scientists
can create the following exponential equation to describe the amount of
carbon-14 that is present over time.</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[f(x)=A\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg)^{x/5730}\]</span></p>
<p>In this equation <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> represents
the amount of carbon-14 initially present in the living organism. The
input for this function is time (in years) since the organism died and
the output is the current amount of carbon-14 present in the organic
material.</p>
<p>If a particular ivory tusk from an elephant had 0.35 grams of
carbon-14 present when the elephant was living, the equation will
become:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[f(x)=0.35\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg)^{x/5730}\]</span></p>
<p><img src="Lesson8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If researchers test a piece of ivory and find there are currently
0.30 grams of carbon-14 present, how old would this piece of ivory be?
Looking at the graph, the red line shows that the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-value will be 0.3 after a little more
than 1000 years. So this piece of ivory is over 1000 years old.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the lesson, we mentioned new techniques for
carbon-14 dating developed by researchers at the University of Utah.
Because carbon-14 has such a long half-life, it isn’t very helpful at
determining the age of organic materials that are less than about 50,000
years old. New methods developed by the University of Utah researchers
are particularly helpful in fighting poaching because they found a way
to make carbon-14 dating work for specimens that are only 30-50 years
old.</p>

Understand the Problem
</h4>
<p>Viktor’s business is an online tractor sales business. Viktor does
not have a store and runs the business out of his home. Most of his
business is done through his website and over his phone. He believes his
sales will increase if more people see his website. He decides to use
Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to market his business. He wants these
social media tools to drive traffic to his website.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step two">
Identify Variables &amp; Assumptions
</h4>
<p>Viktor finds a marketing company willing to run a social media
marketing campaign for his business for a fixed monthly fee. The company
offers three levels of service with different costs. As he thinks about
his situation, Viktor identifies the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of customers visiting his website per week</li>
<li>The number of customers who purchase a tractor per week</li>
<li>The percentage of paying customers who visited his website</li>
<li>His average monthly sales</li>
<li>The choice of marketing plan from the marketing company (Plan A,
Plan B, or Plan C)</li>
<li>The cost of hiring marketing company</li>
</ul>
<p>He makes the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The claims of the social media marketing company are accurate. They
claim:
<ul>
<li>Plan A (highest expense) will increase the traffic to his website by
5% per month.</li>
<li>Plan B (medium expense) will increase the traffic to his website by
3.5% per month.</li>
<li>Plan C (lowest expense) will increase the traffic to his website by
2% per month.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If more customers visit his website, he will sell more
tractors.</li>

<p>Analytics for his website show that he currently gets around 75
unique visitors to his website per month. He hopes to double the number
of visits per month to 150 unique visitors per month.</p>
<p>Because the marketing plans claim to increase traffic to his website
by a fixed percentage every month, Douglas recognizes the number of
visits can be described with an exponential function. He creates the
following three exponential functions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Plan A:   } f(x)=75 (1.05)^x\\  
\text{Plan B:   } f(x)=75 (1.035)^x\\
\text{Plan C:   } f(x)=75 (1.02)^x\]</span></p>
<p>In these equations, the input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
represents the number of months the social media marketing campaign has
been running. The output <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>
represents the number of visitors to the website that month.</p>
<p>Viktor created the following graph with the three exponential
functions on the same graph to compare the three plans.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Because he is trying to get to 150 website visitors per month, he
decides to draw a line on the graph at <span
class="math inline">\(y=150\)</span> so he can see how long it will take
to reach 150 website visitors with each plan.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson8_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Looking at the graph, he finds where the line intersects each curve.
The <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-value at the intersection
point will represent the number of months required double the traffic to
his website:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Plan</th>
<th>Approximate Number of Months</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Plan A</td>
<td>about 14 months</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Plan B</td>
<td>about 20 months</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Plan C</td>
<td>about 35 months</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>He realizes that Plan A is the fastest, Plan B takes about 6 months
longer than Plan A, and Plan C takes about 15 months longer than Plan
B.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step four">
Make an Informed Decision
</h4>
<p>Using the results of his computations, Viktor compares the cost of
each plan to the length of time required to double the traffic to his
website (see chart above). He finds that Plan A is quite a bit more
expensive than Plan B, but Plan B doesn’t take that much longer to
double the traffic to his website. Although Plan C is the cheapest, it
takes much more time to get the result he wants.</p>
<p>Viktor selects Plan B.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step five">
Evaluate Your Reasoning
</h4>
<p>After using the marketing company for 6 months, Viktor decides to
reevaluate his assumptions. He reviews his website traffic over the 6
months to see how things are going. According to the claims of the
Social Media Marketing Company, he should have seen approximately a 3.5%
increase of traffic to his website each month. He decides to compare the
actual number of visits to his website to the predicted number of visits
from the exponential function he used to make his decision. In the table
below, the second column shows the predicted website visitors if the
marketing plan worked as expected. The third column shows the actual
number of visitors to the website.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Month</th>
<th>Predicted visitors</th>
<th>Actual visitors</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=75(1.035)^1=77.63\)</span></td>
<td>80</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=75(1.035)^2=80.34\)</span></td>
<td>81</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=75(1.035)^3=83.15\)</span></td>
<td>85</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=75(1.035)^4=86.06\)</span></td>
<td>79</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=75(1.035)^5=89.07\)</span></td>
<td>87</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>6</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(f(1)=75(1.035)^6=92.19\)</span></td>
<td>93</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>He notices that there was a dip in Month 4 with fewer visitors than
expected. He was not concerned because Month 4 was December, which is
usually the slowest month for his business and he found the number of
visitors was back up to the expected amount by Month 6. He determines
the Social Media Marketing is working as expected.</p>
<p>Now that he knows more customers are visiting his website, he decides
to examine the accuracy of his assumption that more website visitors
will increase tractor sales. He compares his current sales to sales for
the same months the previous year and finds on average his sales have
increased by 4% since hiring the social media marketing company. Viktor
is pleased with the results of his decision using the Quantitative
Reasoning Process and plans to keep using the company.</p>
