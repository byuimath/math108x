<h2>Making Choices</h2>
<p>Every day we make many choices. We choose which products to buy,
which candidate will get our vote, how we will take care of our health,
what to do with our money, and even what we will believe.</p>
<p>To make good decisions using quantitative reasoning we need to be
familiar with the tools of the Quantitative Reasoning Process. We also
need to understand some of the pitfalls that can misdirect us when we
try to reason through decisions. When someone makes an argument, the
person gives reasons with the goal of convincing others that a
conclusion is right or wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Logical Reasoning</em> is the process of analyzing and evaluating
arguments in order to draw valid conclusions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Logical reasoning is key to making good decisions in all aspects of
our lives. Last week, we introduced the Quantitative Reasoning model.
Recall that the purpose of the model was to help you make informed
decisions that are based on sound reasoning with quantitative
evidence.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="Lesson2/Images/QRProcess.png"
alt="Quantitative Reasoning Model" /></p>
</center>
<p>People frequently use logical reasoning to try to influence our
decisions. When logical reasoning is used to support a specific
conclusion, we call it a <em>logical argument</em>. Sometimes we use
logical arguments to persuade someone to make a choice with a particular
outcome. Logical arguments present reasons for accepting a
conclusion.</p>
<div id="propositions-and-conditional-statements"
class="section level3">
<h3>Propositions and Conditional Statements</h3>
<p>Logical arguments are created by combining together one or more
<em>propositions</em> and <em>conditional statements</em>.</p>
<div id="propositions" class="section level4">
<h4>Propositions</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>proposition</em> is a statement that is either true or
false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following statements are all propositions:</p>
<center>
<p>“The sun is the center of our solar system.”</p>
<p>“Mammals have hair.”</p>
<p>“Snakes are mammals.”</p>
<p>“Caleb got an A on the exam.”</p>
</center>
<p>Notice that each of these statements is either true or false. “The
sun is the center of our solar system” is an example of a true
proposition, while “Snakes are mammals” is an example of a false
proposition. Both are propositions because they are statements that are
either true or false.</p>
<p>Only statements can be propositions. For example, “Is it raining?” is
not a proposition because it is a question instead of a statement. “Hey
you! Come here!” is not a proposition because it is a command and has no
truth value.</p>
</div>
<div id="conditional-statements" class="section level4">
<h4>Conditional Statements</h4>
<p>Conditional statements are a particular type of proposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>conditional statement</em> is a proposition with an if-then
structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following statements are all conditional statements:</p>
<center>
<p>“If the basketball team wins this game, then they will go to the
state championship.”</p>
<p>“If you take out student loans, then you will have to repay them
after you graduate.”</p>
<p>“If ye love me, keep my commandments.”</p>
</center>
<p>Conditional statements are made up of two parts: the “if” part and
the “then” part.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “if” part of a conditional statement is called an assumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The “then” part of a conditional statement is called a
conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some propositions don’t use the if-then wording, but can be reworded
as a conditional Statement. These propositions are called
<strong>implied conditional statements</strong>. Key words like “all”,
“whenever”, “always”, “never”, “every time”, and “none” help us identify
implied conditional statements.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>“All dogs are mammals” is an implied conditional statement. We could
reword it as “If an animal is a dog, then it is a mammal.” The
assumption of this implied conditional statement is “If an animal is a
dog” and the conclusion is “then it is a mammal.”</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>“You are tired in the morning whenever you stay out late” is an
implied conditional statement because it could be reworded as “If you
stay out late, then you will be tired in the morning.” In this example
the assumption is “If you stay out late” and the conclusion is “then you
will be tired in the morning.”</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step two">
Identify Variables &amp; Assumptions
</h4>
<p>Notice that the second step of the Quantitative Reasoning Process is
to “identify variables and assumptions.” Understanding that a
conditional statement is made up of an assumption and a conclusion helps
us apply the Quantitative Reasoning Process correctly. For example, in
the last lesson we saw Lucas and Amanda make the assumption that their
expenses would stay fairly constant until Lucas finished school. The
conclusions and decisions that we made last week were based on this
assumption. We could write this as a conditional statement:</p>
<center>
<p>“If Lucas and Amanda’s expenses stay fairly constant until Lucas
finishes school, then their decision about student loans will be
appropriate.”</p>
</center>
<p>When making decisions it is important to identify the assumptions we
are using. If Lucas and Amanda’s health insurance suddenly increased,
their expenses would not remain constant. This would then affect the
decision they made using the Quantitative Reasoning Process.</p>
<p>Conditional statements show up in a variety of mediums including
technical mediums such as computer codes and financial equations, and
message-based mediums such as the scriptures, advertisements, and
political messages. In message-based mediums, assumptions are not always
stated directly. Sometimes it is assumed that everyone believes the same
thing.</p>
<p>Think about the time when people believed the world was flat. That
assumption led to logical thinking such as: If the world is flat, then
it must have an edge. If there is an edge, then we could fall off the
edge of the world. If we try to sail across the ocean, we will fall off
the edge of the world.</p>
<center>

</div>
</div>
<div id="truth-values-of-conditional-statements" class="section level3">
<h3>Truth Values of Conditional Statements</h3>
<p>Every proposition has a truth value. Since conditional statements are
one type of proposition, this means every conditional statement is
either true or false.</p>
<p>Consider the following conditional statement:</p>
<center>
<p>“If Anthony takes this pill, then his headache will go away.”</p>
</center>
<p>Is this conditional statement true or false?</p>
<p>Without having more information there isn’t really a clear answer.
The only way we can <em>know</em> if the statement is true or false is
to have Anthony take the pill and see whether or not his headache goes
away. If Anthony doesn’t take the pill, then the best we can do is to
<em>assume</em> the statement is true.</p>
<p><strong>This is always the case.</strong> In order to determine the
truth value of a conditional statement, we need to know the truth value
of the assumption and the truth value of the conclusion.</p>
<p>In this example, there are four different possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anthony took the pill and his headache went away.</li>
<li>Anthony took the pill and his headache did not go away.</li>
<li>Anthony did not take the pill and his headache went away.</li>
<li>Anthony did not take the pill and his headache did not go away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one of these possibilities would make the conditional statement
false. If Anthony took the pill and his headache did not go away, then
the conditional statement was false.</p>
<p>The conditional statement can only be true if Anthony took the pill
and his headache went away.</p>
<p>If Anthony didn’t take the pill, then we have no way of knowing if
his headache would have gone away. In this situation we follow the same
“innocent until proven guilty” strategy that is used in a court of law.
Because Anthony didn’t take the pill we have no way of knowing if it
would have made his headache go away. Therefore, we give the claim the
benefit of the doubt and assume the conditional statement is true.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates three important principles about the truth
value of conditional statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A conditional statement is FALSE when the assumption is true and the
conclusion is false.</li>
<li>A conditional statement is TRUE when the assumption is true and the
conclusion is true.</li>
<li>A conditional statement is <em>assumed</em> to be TRUE when the
assumption is false. (The conclusion could be either true or false.)
Because the assumption is false, there is no way to tell whether the
conditional statement is true, so we give the benefit of the doubt and
assume the conditional statement to be true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conditional statements are called <em>conditional</em> because their
truth value depends on the truth of the assumption. The assumption tells
us the <em>conditions</em> that have to be true for the conclusion to be
guaranteed to be true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a true conditional statement, if the assumption is true then the
conclusion is guaranteed to always be true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to understand that the Quantitative Reasoning Process
will lead to a conclusion that is based on a conditional statement. When
we make a decision using the Quantitative Reasoning Process, it is only
guaranteed to be a good decision if the assumptions we used are found to
be true.</p>
<p>If our assumptions are false, then our conclusion may or may not be
accurate. <strong>Anytime we make an informed decision using
quantitative reasoning, it is important to be aware that our conclusion
is only guaranteed to be true if the assumptions we made are accurate
and true.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at a few other examples of conditional statements.</p>
<div id="example-3" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 3</h4>
<p>Under what conditions would the following conditional statement be
false?</p>
<center>
<p>“If the basketball team wins this game, then they will go to the
state championship.”</p>
</center>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> As stated in the principle given above, a
conditional statement is false if the assumption is true and the
conclusion is false. In this example that would mean that the basketball
team wins this game (so the assumption is true) but they don’t get to go
to the state championship (the conclusion is false).</p>
</div>
<div id="example-4" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 4</h4>
<p>Using the same conditional statement from example 1, let’s say that
the basketball team loses the game, but they still end up getting to go
to the state championship. Is the conditional statement true or
false?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The conditional statement as a whole is
assumed to be true. In this case, the assumption of the conditional
statement is false (they didn’t win the game), so the conclusion may or
may not be true (they might get to go to the state championship and they
might not). Either way, the conditional statement is assumed to be
<strong>true</strong> because the assumption is false. We don’t know
what would have happened if they had won the game, so we give the
benefit of the doubt to the original conditional statement and assume
the statement to be true.</p>

<div id="conditional-statements-in-the-scriptures"
class="section level3">
<h3>Conditional Statements in the Scriptures</h3>
<p>Looking for logical structures can help us better understand all
types of logical arguments, including those found in the scriptures.
Many of the conditional statements found in the scriptures are promises.
If we do our part to make the assumption true, the conclusion is
guaranteed to follow.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<div id="example-5" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 5</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue
in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assumption in this scripture is “if you continue in my word” and
the conclusion is “then are ye my disciples indeed.” Because we know
this scripture is true, this tells us if we continue to read, study, and
follow the words of the Savior, then we are guaranteed to be His
disciples.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-6" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 6</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If ye love me, keep my commandments.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assumption in this scripture is “if ye love me” and the
conclusion is “keep my commandments”. Because we know this scripture is
true, we know if we love the Savior, we will keep his commandments.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-7" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 7</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our
hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not been found in us, then
will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assumption in this scripture is “if we have hardened our hearts
against the word” and the conclusion is “then will our state be awful,
for then we shall be condemned.” Because we know this scripture is true,
we know if we harden our hearts against the word, we are guaranteed to
be condemned.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-8" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 8</h4>
<p>In addition to finding conditional statements in the scriptures, we
often see them in the words of the prophets. Consider the following
statement made by President Gordon B. Hinckley:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If we will give…service [to others], our days will be filled with
joy and gladness.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assumption in this statement is “if we will give service to
others” and the conclusion is “our days will be filled with joy and
gladness.” This promise from a prophet guarantees that we will have days
filled with joy and gladness if we give service to others. Those who do
not choose to serve others may or may not find that same joy and
gladness. It is possible they will, but it is only guaranteed to those
who give service to others.</p>

<div id="activity" class="section level4">
<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Find a scripture or gospel quote that uses a conditional statement.
Conduct a similar analysis and see what you learn about that quote by
considering the logical structure of the argument. You will be asked to

<div id="strength-of-arguments" class="section level2">
<h2>Strength of Arguments</h2>
<p>As we have seen so far in this lesson logical reasoning is an
essential part of the Quantitative Reasoning Process. It is essential
that we clearly understand the assumptions we are making and realize
that our conclusions are only guaranteed to be accurate if our
assumptions are true. Additionally, it is important to understand
persuasive logical arguments we are presented with in the news, social
media, and the internet.</p>
<p>In the opening video for this lesson you saw several ads and
commercials that used faulty reasoning. Logical arguments that use
faulty reasoning are very common. We call this type of argument logical
fallacies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A logical fallacy is an argument that is based on an error in
reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, we will discuss four types of logical fallacies. There
are many others, but these four are some of the most common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improper generalization</li>
<li>Appeal to emotion</li>
<li>Personal attacks</li>
<li>Alternative explanations</li>
</ul>
<div id="improper-generalization" class="section level3">
<h3>Improper Generalization</h3>
<p>The weight loss ad from the introductory video is a great example of
an argument that includes the improper generalization fallacy.</p>
<center>
<img src="Lesson3/Images/Billboard.jpg"
alt="A billboard advertising weight loss, lose 50 lbs without dieting! Others have done it and YOU CAN TOO!" />
</center>
<p>The advertisement implies that because this program has worked for
others, it will work for you too. The ad is not just congratulating the
individual on their weight loss. It is inviting us to join them in
weight loss through this program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The improper generalization fallacy refers to an argument that
concludes that because one individual or group experiences a certain
result, then everyone should experience similar results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The weight loss program may have worked for the individuals referred
to in the ad, but that doesn’t mean it will work for everyone. The
advertisers are trying to get you to spend your money on their
program.</p>
</div>
<div id="appeal-to-emotion" class="section level3">
<h3>Appeal to Emotion</h3>
<p>Another common fallacy is an appeal to emotion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The appeal to emotion fallacy is an argument that claims something is
true because of an emotional reason unrelated to the argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The animal shelter ad shown in the introductory video is a good
example of this.</p>
<center>
<img src="Lesson3/Images/Mag_Adopt_cropped.png"
alt="image displaying an animal shelter ad" />
</center>
</center>
<p>This ad includes a picture of a dog and a tagline that says: “Adopt
today! A pet is waiting for you.” The image and the words combine to
provide an emotional appeal to encourage pet adoption. Note that the
advertisers are trying to influence your actions by appealing to your
emotions.</p>
<p>Another example of an appeal to emotion is shown in the following ad
for Michelin tires.</p>
<p><br></p>
<center>
<img src="Lesson3/Images/Wk3.Tires.jpg" alt="Michelin Tires ad" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Including a baby in this advertisement connects to your emotions by
appealing to your desire to protect children. Rather than telling you
why Michelin tires are better than other tires, it implies that Michelin
tires will help you keep your baby safe. Note, however, that it gives no
evidence for this claim.</p>
</div>
<div id="personal-attacks" class="section level3">
<h3>Personal Attacks</h3>
<p>In the introductory video you heard a political ad promoting Debbie
Williams as the mayor of Garden City. This ad is an example of a
personal attack. The argument presented did not provide any logical
reasons to vote for Debbie Williams; it just attacked Bryce Phillips,
the current mayor of Garden City. The attacks were of a personal nature
rather than attacking his policies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A personal attack fallacy is an argument that is based on attacking
the person making the argument, rather than critiquing the argument on
its own merits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another example of a political ad that uses a personal
attack.</p>
<p><br></p>
<center>
<img src="Lesson3/Images/wk3.political.png" alt="Political Ad" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>This ad is from a State Senator election in Montana in 2014. Notice
that, among other things, the ad claims “Tonya Shellnutt opposes holding
rapists and abusers accountable for their crimes.” This is clearly an
exaggeration that portrays Ms. Shellnutt in a poor light. It is unlikely
that Ms. Shellnutt wants rapists and abusers to have no consequences for
their actions, and equally unlikely that she would like Montana women
and families to be in danger. The ad attacks Ms. Shellnutt personally
because of her position on a particular piece of legislation, instead of
addressing the actual law to which it refers.</p>
</div>
<div id="alternative-explanations" class="section level3">
<h3>Alternative Explanations</h3>
<p>Did you know that more drownings occur in months where ice cream
consumption is high? This must mean that ice cream consumption causes
drowning, right?</p>
<p>Rather than making that conclusion, we should consider whether there
is an alternative explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The alternative explanation fallacy refers to an argument where a
conclusion is made without adequately considering other explanations
that might explain the observed effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, we should consider the weather. People tend to eat
ice cream more often in warmer weather. And people go swimming more when
the weather is warmer. So the increase in drowning deaths is most likely
due to an increase in the number of people swimming during warmer
weather. It has nothing to do with ice cream.</p>
<p>We saw another example in the introductory video where the newspaper
headline claimed: “Soda a Day Leads to Heart Attacks in Men.”<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Researchers found a correlation between soda drinking and heart attacks.
But just knowing there is a correlation does not mean the researchers
can conclude that drinking a soda every day causes the heart attack.
There may be other alternative explanations.</p>
<p>Another historical example relates to smoking and lung cancer. Prior
to the 1900s, lung cancer was very rare. However, as smoking became more
popular, doctors noticed an increase in the occurrence of lung cancer.
In the 1920s and 1930s, doctors started noticing a correlation between
smoking and lung cancer. However many alternative explanations were
suggested, especially by the tobacco industry. In the 1960s, only about
one-third of US doctors believed that lung cancer was caused by smoking.
Before concluding that smoking <em>causes</em> lung cancer, doctors had
to rule out any possible alternative explanations. This took many
carefully designed scientific studies over many years. Some of those
studies looked at the prevalence of smoking in different areas of the
world and compared it to the prevalence of lung cancer in that area. In
this example, researchers were eventually able to eliminate alternative
explanations and show that most cases of lung cancer are indeed caused
by smoking.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This lesson highlights the importance of understanding logical
arguments when making decisions. In the Quantitative Reasoning Process
we make assumptions. It is important to keep in mind that the validity
of the decisions we make are conditional. If the assumptions are true,
and our conclusions are logically tied to our assumptions, then our
conclusions are true.</p>
<p>We also need to be aware of logical fallacies when we examine logical
arguments. Logical fallacies such as improper generalizations, appeals
to emotion, personal attacks, and alternative explanations can lead to
invalid conclusions.</p>
