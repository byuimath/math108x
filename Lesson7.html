<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Like Craig, there are many reasons why you may need to borrow money
at some point in your lifetime. A loan can provide funds for you to
purchase a home, buy a car, get an education, or start a small business
without the delay that would be caused by saving the necessary money.
However, planning ahead and saving money prior to a purchase can help us
avoid borrowing money unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Our church leaders have counseled us to be wise in how we manage our
personal finances and to avoid debt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Look to the condition of your finances. Discipline yourself in your
purchases, avoiding debt to the extent you can. In most cases, you can
avoid debt by managing your resources wisely. If you do incur debt, such
as a reasonable amount in order to purchase a modest home or complete
your education, work to repay it as quickly as possible and free
yourself from bondage. When you have paid your debts and accumulated
some savings, you will be prepared for financial storms that may come
your way. You will have shelter for your family and peace in your
heart.” <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning Process can be a great tool to help us
follow this advice and manage our resources wisely. Contributing money
to a savings account can help us acquire finances we need to make
purchases. However, if you do need to borrow money, it is essential that
you understand the calculations necessary to make an informed decision.
In this lesson we will learn about functions and how they can be used as
part of the Quantitative Reasoning Process to make informed decisions
about savings and loans.</p>

<p>In the following video, Henry J. Eyring, President of BYU-Idaho
shares a personal experience he had in following the council of church
leaders to get out of debt.</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<p><em>Mathematical functions</em> are a useful mathematical tool. They
provide a way to think about complex situations, such as savings and
loans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A function is a rule that assigns the input value(s) to a single
output value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to understand that a function deals with inputs and
outputs. The function itself provides a way to determine which output
corresponds with a given input. Here is an analogy to help explain
functions:</p>

<p>Although functions always assign a single output once the input has
been chosen, it is possible for a function to have several inputs. For
example, the Body Mass Index (BMI) is used to determine if an individual
is has healthy body weight. The BMI is calculated using a function with
two inputs. If you put your body weight and height into the function as
inputs, the output is your BMI.</p>
<hr>
<div id="this-is-a-function-of-that" class="section level3">
<h3>“This” is a function of “That”</h3>
<p>In English, we often say that one thing <em>is a function of</em>
something else. Or one variable <em>depends on</em> another variable.
These phrases relate to the mathematical concept of a function. For
example, suppose someone said one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How well you do on the test is a function of how much time you
spend studying.”</li>
<li>“Your starting salary when you graduate depends on your major.”</li>
<li>“The price of a used car depends on the make and model of the car,
as well as its age and condition.”</li>
<li>“Your monthly cash flow is a function of your income and
expenses.”</li>
<li>“The amount you can borrow for the purchase of a home is a function
of your net monthly income.”</li>
<li>“Your Body Mass Index (BMI) depends on your height and weight.”</li>
<li>“What you get out of sacrament meeting is a function of the amount
of preparation you do.”</li>
</ul>
<p>These statements all correspond to the mathematical definition of a
function. Each situation includes at least one <em>input</em> and an
<em>output</em>. The inputs and outputs of each of these statements are
summarized in the following table:</p>
<center>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<h3>Function Notation</h3>
<p>In addition to knowing the inputs and outputs, you need to know the
rule associated with each function. In mathematics, we use function
notation to write the rules for functions. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x)=5x-2
\]</span></p>
<p>This function is named <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. The
input is <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the rule to find the
output is <span class="math inline">\(5x-2\)</span>. If we used an input
of <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>, we would get <span
class="math display">\[f(1)=5(1)-2=3.\]</span> We write this as <span
class="math inline">\(f(1)=3\)</span>. If we used an input of <span
class="math inline">\(x=2\)</span>, we would get <span
class="math display">\[f(2)=5(2)-2=8.\]</span> This would be written as
<span class="math inline">\(f(2)=8\)</span>. And so on.</p>
<p>We could use this method to list some of the inputs and outputs for
this function.</p>
<center>
<div style="padding-left: 25px; width: 25%;">
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></th>
<th><span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="math inline">\(1\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(3\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><span class="math inline">\(2\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(8\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="math inline">\(3\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(13\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><span class="math inline">\(4\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(18\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="math inline">\(5\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(23\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><span class="math inline">\(6\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(28\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</center>
<p>From the table we see that <span
class="math inline">\(f(4)=18\)</span>. This means if there is an input
of 4, the output is 18.</p>

<h4>Example 1 - One Input</h4>
<p>Assume you have a savings account that earns 0.95% interest each year
(compounded daily). If you put $500 into the account initially, the
amount of money in your account will grow over time as interest is added
to your account. A function for the amount of money in the account after
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> months is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(t)=500(1.000026027)^{30.4167t}
\]</span> (Note: We will learn more about where this function comes from
in Week 9. We included a lot of decimal places for this function
because, with this particular function, if you round the decimals too
much it introduces a lot of rounding error and you lose accuracy.)</p>
<p>Use this function to answer the following questions: a) what is the
input of this function, b) what is the output of the function, and c)
how much money will you have in your account after 4 years and 2
months?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The account balance is a function of how long the money has been in
the account.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The input is the number of months the money has been in the
account.</li>
<li>The output is the amount of money in the account.</li>
<li>If we have had the money in the account for 4 years and 2 months (50
months total), we would use 50 as the input. The output then tells us
the balance of the account:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(50)=500(1.000026027)^{(30.4167*50)}=$520.19
\]</span></p>
<p>After 50 months, the account balance is $520.19, which means we
earned $20.19 in interest over the four years and two months.</p>

<div id="example-2---two-inputs" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 2 - Two Inputs</h4>
<p>The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number often used to determine if an
individual is a healthy weight. If <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> represents your weight (in pounds) and
<span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> represents your height (in
inches), then the function for finding your BMI is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(w,h)=\frac{720w}{h^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Use this function to answer the following questions: a) what are the
inputs of this function, b) what is the output of the function, and c)
what is the BMI of a person who weighs 125 pounds and is 63 inches
tall?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>In this case, the BMI is a function of height and weight.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The inputs of the function are height (in inches) and weight (in
pounds).</li>
<li>The output of the function is the individual’s BMI.</li>
<li>To find the BMI of a person who weighs 125 pounds and is 63 inches
tall, we evaluate the function with 125 substituted in for <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and 63 substituted in for <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(125,63)=\frac{720\times 125}{63^2}=22.68
\]</span></p>
<p>A healthy BMI is generally between 19 and 25, so this person would be
considered to have a healthy body weight.</p>
<p>(Note: If body weight is measured in kilograms and height is measured
in meters, the function is even simpler. In that case, <span
class="math inline">\(f(w,h)=\frac{w}{h^2}\)</span>.)</p>

<h2>Functions in Excel</h2>
<p>Throughout the semester we have been using Excel to do computations.
Excel uses the function concept to carry out these calculations. Open
Excel and create a spreadsheet that matches the spreadsheet shown in the
following screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="Lesson7/Images/wk7.excel1.jpg"
alt="Excel screenshot" /></p>
<p>In this case we will create a function in Excel with several inputs
and a single output. We want the inputs to be: rent, car payment, car
insurance, groceries, clothes, and entertainment. We want the output to
be Total Expenses.</p>
<p>We could say that the <em>Total Expenses</em> are a function of the
amount spent on rent, car payment, car insurance, groceries, clothes,
and entertainment.</p>
<p>We can create a function in Excel that will calculate the output for
us. In this case, we will use the <em>Sum</em> function. Notice that
Excel uses function notation similar to what we would use in
mathematics. As shown in the red circle in the following image, we can
see that the function <em>f(x)</em> is equal to the sum of the entries
in cells B2 through B7. The inputs of the function are $350, $125, $30,
$150, $40 and $40. The rule used for this function is a sum, so we add
these numbers together to get the output: $735.00.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson7/Images/wk7.excel3.jpg"
alt="Excel screenshot showing Sum Function" /></p>
<p>This semester we have already seen several other functions that are
built into Excel. For example, we have computed the average, the
minimum, the maximum, and the standard deviation. These are all examples
of functions that are built into Excel.</p>
<p>One purpose in learning about functions is to help us better
understand loan calculations. Excel has several built-in functions that
will be beneficial to us. But in order to use them, we have to
understand how to enter the inputs of the function into Excel so it can
compute the output.</p>

<h2>Some Special Excel Functions</h2>
<p>There are a few functions in Excel that will be useful as we work on
loan calculations. Some of these are functions we have seen before and
some of them are new. Here is a summary of some helpful functions.</p>

</table>
</div>
<p>Notice for each of these functions the syntax is the same. They
always start with an equal sign, which tells Excel you want to use a
function. They then have the name of the function, this tells Excel
which rule to use for the function. They then have a list of inputs.
This allows Excel to use the correct rule for the inputs you give and
find the appropriate output. Notice how well this corresponds to our
definition of a mathematical function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A function is a rule that assigns each input value(s) to a unique
output value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> In Excel, positive and negative
signs are used to distinguish between money you get and money you pay.
Any money that figuratively leaves your wallet would be entered in Excel
as a negative number. Any money figuratively entering your wallet would
be entered in Excel as a positive number. Here are some examples:</p>

<h2>Savings and Loans</h2>
<p>When making a purchase, we generally have two options. We can save
the money and pay at the time of purchase; or we can get a loan to pay
for the item. For most purchases, it is wise to save the money first.
For some very large purchases, such as a home, it is worthwhile to get a
loan because it allows us to make the purchase without having to save a
large amount of money.</p>
<div id="the-future-value-function"
class="section level3 tabset tabset-fade">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-fade">The Future Value Function</h3>
<p>The future value (FV) function can be very helpful when you want to
find out how much money you will have in an investment (like a savings
account or a retirement fund) after a certain amount of time. It
computes the balance of the investment account given an interest rate,
the number of periods, and the payment.</p>
<div id="example-3---savings-account" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 3 - Savings Account</h4>
<p>Anya is saving money for emergencies. After creating a budget, she
realizes she can contribute $210 to her savings account every month. Her
savings account earns 0.95% interest annually. How much money will she
have in her emergency savings account after 5 years?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>In this situation, Anya needs to know the interest rate, the number
of periods, and the monthly payment in order to use the future value
(FV) command in Excel.</p>
<p>Because she gives the monthly payment to the bank every month, it
should be a negative number (Excel used parentheses to show a negative
number in the image below).</p>
<p>After entering the information shown below, she finds that the
balance of her savings account will be $12,898.82 after she saves for 5
years.</p>

<div id="example-4---retirement-savings" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 4 - Retirement Savings</h4>
<p>Doug is currently 42 years old and earns $42,000 per year. He just
decided to start saving for retirement. He starts contributing 8% of his
salary to his 401K retirement account every month. His employer also
contributes by paying 4% of Doug’s salary to his 401K account each
month. Assuming Doug’s salary stays the same for the rest of his career
and that he retires at age 65, how much money will Doug have when he
retires if his 401K has an average annual interest rate of 5.2%?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>In order to use the future value (FV) function in Excel to find the
future value of his 401K retirement account, Doug needs to know how much
he and his employer contributes each month.</p>
<p>Doug contributes 8% of his salary: <span
class="math inline">\(0.08\times\$42000=\$3360\)</span><br />
His employer contributes 4% of Doug’s salary: <span
class="math inline">\(0.04\times\$42000=\$1680\)</span><br />
Total annual contribution: <span
class="math inline">\(\$3360+\$1680=\$5040\)</span><br />
Total monthly contribution: <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\$5040}{12}=\$420\)</span></p>
<p>See the Excel input below to see how this information was used in
Excel to compute the future value of Doug’s retirement account.</p>
<p>Using the formula shown below shows us that Doug will have
$222,761.17 when he retires.</p>

<div id="the-payment-function"
class="section level3 tabset tabset-fade">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-fade">The Payment Function</h3>
<p>When we do need to borrow money, it is important to make sure that
the loan payment amount fits within your monthly budget. The payment
function (PMT) in Excel helps determine what the monthly payment would
be on a loan. Here are a few examples:</p>
<div id="example-5---student-loan" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 5 - Student Loan</h4>
<p>Emilee is an online student who needs to take out a student loan to
finish her degree. She needs to borrow $2800 and will pay it back after
she graduates. She can pay it off over 10 years with an interest rate of
4.2%. What would her monthly payments be once she graduates?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The payment function in Excel can help Emilee find her monthly
payment. She needs to enter the interest rate, years, and loan amount.
Because she wants to know a <em>monthly</em> payment, all inputs in the
formula must be in months. We have to divide the annual interest rate by
12 to get a <em>monthly</em> interest rate. We also have to multiply the
number of years by 12 to find the number of months.</p>
<p>Using the formula shown below tells us Emilee would pay $28.62 per
month to pay off her student loan.</p>
<p>Notice the loan amount is a positive number, because when Emilee gets
the loan she will receive that money. But the monthly payment will be
negative, because that is money she has to pay each month. Excel uses a
negative sign, a red number, or a number in parentheses to indicate a
negative value.</p>

</div>
<div id="example-6---small-business-example" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 6 - Small Business Example</h4>
<p>Andrew is starting a construction company and needs to purchase tools
and supplies to begin his business. His calculations show he needs
$45,000 to get his business started. He has $9,000 saved to put toward
his start-up expenses, so he only needs to borrow $36,000. His bank will
give him a 5-year small-business loan with an interest rate of 3.5%.
What will his monthly payment be?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
The payment function in Excel would help Andrew answer this question. He
needs to input the interest rate, the number of terms, and the total
loan amount. Excel will then give the monthly payment as the output.</p>
<p>We entered the following formula into Excel to get the answer. Notice
that because we want a <em>monthly</em> payment, we have to divide the
annual interest rate by 12 to get a <em>monthly</em> interest rate. We
also have to multiply the number of years by 12 to find the number of
months.</p>
<p>Notice the loan amount is a positive number and the monthly payment
is negative.</p>
<p>Andrew’s monthly payment would be $654.90.</p>

<h3>Craig’s Car Loan</h3>
<p>In the opening video we saw that Craig needed a loan to purchase a
new car. We will use the Quantitative Reasoning Process to find which
loan option Craig should choose. As we go through the process we will
see the usefulness of the functions in Excel.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step one">
Understand the Problem
</h4>
<p>The real world problem in this situation is that Craig needs to
choose a loan for a new car. The loan is for $5000 with an annual
interest rate of 4%. Craig knows he will pay less interest if he
finances the car for a shorter time period. But he can only afford to
pay up to $100 per month on a car payment. The bank offers 3, 4, 5, 6 or
7 year loans.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step two">
Identify Variables &amp; Assumptions
</h4>
<p>The variables in this situation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>His monthly payment: <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span></li>
<li>The length of the loan: <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>His monthly payment depends on the length of the loan. Using the
vocabulary of functions we would say that the monthly payment is a
function of the length of the loan. The length of the loan is the input
and the monthly payment is the output.</p>
<p>We are making the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of the car is $5000.</li>
<li>The APR is 4%.</li>
<li>Craig wants to finance the car for the shortest time period
possible.</li>
<li>Craig can only pay $100 per month for his car payment.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 class="step three">
Apply Quantitative Tools
</h4>
<p>Click on each of the following steps to see Excel calculations that
help determine the length of the loan Craig should get.</p>
<div id="excel-instructions" class="section level5 tabset tabset-fade">
<h5 class="tabset tabset-fade">Excel Instructions</h5>
<div id="step-1" class="section level6">
<h6>Step 1</h6>
<p>We will use the payment function in Excel, so we know our inputs are
the interest rate, the number of years, and the loan amount. Our output
will be the monthly payment.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson7/Images/wk7.excel5.jpg"
alt="Excel spreadsheet" /></p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="step-2" class="section level6">
<h6>Step 2</h6>
<p>The rate is 4% per year, we will start by using 3 years as the length
of the loan, and the loan amount is $5000. We have to be sure to convert
all of our inputs to be in monthly units.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson7/Images/wk7.excel6.jpg"
alt="Excel spreadsheet" /></p>
<hr>
</div>
<div id="step-3" class="section level6">
<h6>Step 3</h6>
<p>This Excel calculation tells us that if Craig gets a 3-year loan his
monthly payment would be $147.62. This is more than the $100 that Craig
knows he can afford, so he should consider other loan lengths.</p>
<p><img src="Lesson7/Images/wk7.craig.jpg" /></p>
<hr>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section" class="section level5">
<h5></h5>
<p>We will look at different inputs for this variable to determine which
length of loan to choose.</p>
<p>Using the formulas we entered into Excel you should get the following
values as you change the number of years for the loan:</p>
<center>
<div style="width: 25%;">
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Number of Years</th>
<th>Payment</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>$147.62</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td>$112.90</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>5</td>
<td>$92.08</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>6</td>
<td>$78.23</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>7</td>
<td>$68.34</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</center>
<hr>
<h4 class="step four">
Make an Informed Decision
</h4>
<p>Since Craig can only afford a $100 loan payment per month, he should
choose the 5 year loan with a car payment of $92.08.</p>
<hr>
<h4 class="step five">
Evaluate Your Reasoning
</h4>
<p>When we reflect on the decision, we should consider whether we have
made the best decision. Some people might argue that Craig should
finance the car for 7 years because that makes the payment lower.
However, we have to realize that means he has to pay interest for a
longer period of time, so the entire loan will cost more money. We can
find the total cost of the loan by multiplying the payment by 12 (to
find out how much you pay per year) and then multiplying that by the
number of years the loan is financed. Doing so for this problem tells us
the total cost of the loan for each of the 5 options.</p>
<center>
<div style="width: 50%;">

<tr class="header">
<th>Number of Years</th>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>7</td>
<td>$68.34</td>
<td>$5740.90</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</center>
<p>This shows if Craig finances the car loan for 7 years he would pay
$5740.90 for the loan, but if he finances it for 5 years he will only
pay $5524.96. So Craig will save $215.94 by selecting the shortest loan
he can afford.</p>

<h3>Excel - Absolute and Relative Cell References</h3>
<p>One of the benefits of using Excel is that it allows you to use
formulas. Additionally, you can copy and paste the formulas to help make
it easier to create a useful spreadsheet.</p>
<p><em>Cell References</em> are used within Excel formulas to refer to
information located in another cell in the spreadsheet. There are two
types of cell references: <em>relative cell references</em> and
<em>absolute cell references</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relative cell references refer to a cell by giving its column and row
(for example: A1). Absolute cell references use dollar signs when
referring to a cell (for example: $A$1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference between these two types of cell references is how they
behave when they are copied and pasted to another cell. Relative cell
references <strong>change</strong> when they are copied and pasted to a
new cell. Absolute cell references <strong>remain constant</strong> when
they are copied and pasted. The following animation demonstrates how
relative and absolute cell references work:</p>

<h3 class="tabset tabset-fade">Excel Instructions - Amortization
Tables</h3>
<p>Now that we know how to use the Payment function in Excel to compute
a monthly payment for a loan, we can learn how to create an amortization
table. We will continue with the same example used in the previous
problem to create an amortization schedule. Remember we are financing a
$5000 car for 5 years at 4% interest.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to create an amortization table for Craig’s loan.
The spreadsheet was intentionally left very plain in order to make it

<p>Now, we use formulas to fill in the Month 1 row. Pay attention to the
dollar signs. They help the formulas copy correctly. Cell references
with dollar signs are <em>absolute cell references</em> and cell
references without dollar signs are <em>relative cell
references</em>.</p>
<p>Here are the formulas you should type in for the first row:</p>
<center>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="8%" />
<col width="8%" />
<col width="82%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Cell Number</th>
<th>Formula</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>G3</td>
<td>=-B9</td>
<td>This produces the proper monthly payment. Since the value in B9 is
negative, the negative sign in front of B9 produces a positive value.
Note: if you type 92.08 directly into cell G3, the ending balance will
be off by a penny at the end of month 1. This is because of the rounding
done by typing 92.08 directly, rather than using a cell reference (which
does not round the number).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>D5</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Type the number 1 to indicate Month 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>E5</td>
<td>=$B$6</td>
<td>The Beginning Balance for Month 1 is the Loan Amount listed in cell
B6. The dollar signs indicate an absolute cell reference.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>F5</td>
<td>=$B$4/12*E5</td>
<td>Divide the interest rate from cell B4 by 12 to make it a monthly
rate, then multiply by beginning balance in cell E5 to compute the
interest accrued this month</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>G5</td>
<td>=$G$3-F5</td>
<td>This subtracts the interest from the monthly payment to determine
how much of the payment goes to paying down the loan balance.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>H5</td>
<td>=E5-G5</td>
<td>This subtracts the amount of principal paid from the beginning
balance to find the monthly ending balance.</td>
</tr>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Now we will fill in the formulas for Month 2. After filling in this
row, we will be able to copy these formulas to fill in the rest of the
table.</p>
<center>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="11%" />
<col width="27%" />
<col width="61%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Cell Number</th>
<th>Formula</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>D6</td>
<td>=D5+1</td>
<td>This adds 1 to the month number from the previous cell to give us
the new month number.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>E6</td>
<td>=H5</td>
<td>The ending balance from the previous month becomes this month’s
beginning balance.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>F6</td>
<td>Copy and paste the formula from cell F5</td>
<td>The formula should become =$B$4/12*E6</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>G6</td>
<td>Copy and paste the formula from cell G5</td>
<td>The formula should become =$G$3-F6</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>H6</td>
<td>Copy and paste the formula from cell H5</td>
<td>The formula should become =E6-G6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>
<p>Note that absolute cell references (the ones with dollar signs) did
not change when you copied and pasted them. But the relative cell
references (the ones without dollar signs) changed to refer to the new
row. This is the difference between absolute and relative cell
references.</p>

<div id="step-5" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>If you entered the formulas for the second row correctly, your
spreadsheet should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="Lesson7/Images/wk7.excel9.jpg"

</div>
<div id="step-6" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Copy the entries in the Month 2 row and paste them in the remaining
rows to fill in the rest of the table. The final row should be month 60
because it is a 5-year loan (5 years = 60 months). Only about 11 months
are shown in the screenshot, but the table should continue until Month
60. If everything is done correctly, the Ending Balance in Month 60
should be $0.00.</p>

<p>We can use the Amortization Table to find useful information. For
example, we see that after 2 years (24 months), Craig will still owe
$3118.91 on the loan. We also see that in the first month he paid $16.67
in interest, but in the 24th month he only paid $10.67 in interest. This
is because his account balance is lower and he is paying interest on a
smaller amount of money.</p>
<p>We could also use the SUM function in Excel to add up the interest
payments for all 60 months of the loan. This tells us Craig paid a total
of $524.96 in interest for the loan.</p>
<p>Because we used formulas to create the entire table, we could go back
and change some of the inputs (interest rate, number of years, and
original loan balance) and the entire table would update to reflect the
new information.</p>
